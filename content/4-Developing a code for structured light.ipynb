    "The control of light in its transverse dimension has boosted the interest in the development of new techniques for structuring, sculpting, or tailoring light beams.

Fof simplicity, we shall consider the polatization vector constant, therefore irrelevant. We shall develop, therefore, a description for the scalar field. Also note that the _carrier wave_ is also a simple function, so the relevant information on the structure of the field is contained in the _envelop_. In our code, therefore, we shall focus, therefore, only in thedescription of the complex envelope function $U(\\mathbf{r})$.\n"

    "#### The angular momentum of light\n",
    "\n",
    "One can identify a cornerstone in the development of structured light when Allen and co-workers identified in 1992 the helical phase structure of a laser beam with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.45.8185\">(Allen et al. 1992)</a>. This simple but revolutionary idea boosted the application of structured light beams to many different fields, such as quantum optics, cold atoms, optical communications, microscopy, imaging, metrology, or nonlinear optics, among others <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-021-00780-4\">(Forbes et al. 2021)</a>. \n",

    "Light beams exhibit two degrees of freedom associated to their angular momentum: spin angular momentum (SAM), indicating the direction in which the field oscillates in time, or polarization; and orbital angular momentum (OAM) related to the spatial profile of the phase of the electric wave. SAM is a microscopic property of light fields, characterized by the spin, $\\sigma=\\pm 1$ , and defining the light field polarization, from right ($\\sigma= 1$) or left ($\\sigma=-1$) circularly polarized, to elliptically or linearly polarized depending on the photon spin combination. On the other hand, OAM is related to the transversal spiral-phase structure of a light beam, representing a macroscopic property that that is characterized by the topological charge, $\\ell$—the number of $2\\pi$-phase shifts along the azimuthal coordinate. Remarkably, while the spin is restricted to $\\pm1$, the topological charge can take infinite discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Light beams carrying orbital angular momentum can be anturally described through the well known Laguerre-Gauss modes. LG modes are solutions of the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates, and in this notebook we employ them to describe a laser beam with a vortex spatial structure. \\\n",
    "We shall consider an electric field, linearly polarized along the $x$-direction, propagating in the $z$-direction under the paraxial approximation, and with wavelength $\\lambda_0\\ (k_0=2\\pi/\\lambda_0)$, expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U({\\bf r})= U_0 LG_{\\ell,p}({\\bf r}) e^{-i \\phi_0} \n",

    "The spatial dependence is given by the Laguerre-Gauss modes in cylindrical coordinates as\n",

    "where $\\varphi_s(\\rho,\\phi,z)=\\ell\\phi + {k_0\\rho^2\\over 2R(z)}+\\Phi_G (z)$ is the spatial phase of each mode. The beam waist is given by $w(z)=w_0\\sqrt{1+(z/z_0)^2}$ with $w_0$ the beam waist at focus and $z_0=k_0w_0^2/2$ the Rayleigh distance. $R(z)=z[1+(z_0/z)^2]$ is the radius of curvature, $\\Phi_G(z)=-(2p+|\\ell|+1)\\arctan(z/z_0)$ the Gouy phase, and $L_p^{|\\ell|}$ the associated Laguerre polynomials. The indices $\\ell=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...$ and $p=0,1,2,...$ correspond to the topological charge and the number of non-axial radial nodes of the mode, respectively. \n",

    "Now, let us introduce the definition of a vortex beam as a _type_ option in the class _Beam_.
