    "# Structured laser beams\n",
    "\n",
    "The control of light in its transverse dimension has boosted the interest in the development of new techniques for structuring, sculpting, or tailoring light beams. The general term structured light refers to **light beams with non-homogeneous, non-trivial, distribution of intensity, phase and/or polarization properties in the plane transverse to propagation**.\n",

    "In this notebook we will develop, step by step, a basic program to represent structured laser beams, in the transverse plane $xy$. For simplicity, we shall consider the polarization vector constant, therefore irrelevant. We shall develop, therefore, a description for the scalar field. Also note that the _carrier wave_ is also a simple function, so the relevant information on the structure of the field is contained in the _envelope_. In our code, therefore, we shall focus, therefore, only in the description of the complex envelope function $U(\\mathbf{r})$.\n"

    "One can identify a cornerstone in the development of structured light when Allen and co-workers identified in 1992 the helical phase structure of a laser beam with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.45.8185\">(Allen et al. 1992)</a>. This simple but revolutionary idea boosted the application of structured light beams to many different fields, such as quantum optics, cold atoms, optical communications, microscopy, imaging, metrology, or nonlinear optics, among others <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-021-00780-4\">(Forbes et al. 2021)</a>. \n",

    "Light beams exhibit two degrees of freedom associated to their angular momentum: spin angular momentum (SAM), indicating the direction in which the field oscillates in time, or polarization; and orbital angular momentum (OAM) related to the spatial profile of the phase of the electric wave. SAM is a microscopic property of light fields, characterized by the spin, $\\sigma=\\pm 1$ , and defining the light field polarization, from right ($\\sigma= 1$) or left ($\\sigma=-1$) circularly polarized, to elliptically or linearly polarized depending on the photon spin combination. On the other hand, OAM is related to the transversal spiral-phase structure of a light beam, representing a macroscopic property that that is characterized by the topological charge, $\\ell$—the number of $2\\pi$-phase shifts along the azimuthal coordinate. Remarkably, while the spin is restricted to $\\pm1$, the topological charge can take infinite discrete values.\n",

    "Light beams carrying OAM can be naturally described through the well known Laguerre-Gauss modes. LG modes are solutions of the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates, and in this notebook we employ them to describe a laser beam with a vortex spatial structure. \\\n",

The indices $\\ell=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...$ and $p=0,1,2,...$ correspond to the topological charge and the number of non-axial radial nodes of the mode, respectively. \n",

In other words, an optical skyrmion is a two- or three-dimensional configuration of the light’s polarization vector that maps every possible polarization state (linear, elliptical, circular) in a continuous, nontrivial way. This texture is robust against small perturbations because it is characterized by a topological number (the skyrmion number) that counts how many times the local polarization vectors wrap around the Poincaré sphere.
