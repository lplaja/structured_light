Next we will introduce Lists and Dictionaries. At that point it will be necessary that you learn hoow to duplicate these structures, using `copy` and `deepcopy` instead of the assignament `=`. After this we will jump to funtions and finish the lesson with a brief word on Python modules. Loop and consitional structures will be introduced _on the fly_ without devoting specific sections to them. \n",
